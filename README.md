# Dungeon generator (C++)


This dungeon generator is based off the work presented here: https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/how-to-use-bsp-trees-to-generate-game-maps--gamedev-12268t

The code used in the tutorial had to be translated form Actionscript to C++, and this is the result. Anyone is free to use this port for their own use.
